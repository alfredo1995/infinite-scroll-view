Technical test for a senior Unity developer focused on creating and optimizing a Infinite and recyclable scrollview. 

Develop a ScrollView in Unity that is infinite and recyclable, optimized to handle a large number of elements 
without compromising performance. 

<br>

Part 1: Practical Implementation

Develop an infinite and recyclable Scrollview that can be used in webgl mobile and desktop applications. 

    1. Basic Functionality:
    
        Scrollview should be able to load and recycle elements
        efficiently without performance loss when scrolling up and down infinitely.

        Data can be simple numbers or texts that represent items.

    2. Interface and Interaction:
    
        Implement visual feedback to show that charging is occurring when new items are being uploaded. 
        Make sure the scroll is smooth and without visual jumps or "lags".

    3. Data:
        Use a list of fictitious data (for example, a list of names or numbers) to demonstrate a functionality.

    4. Extras:
        
    Implement a “pull-to-refresh” feature at the top of the list.
    Add functionality to detect when the user reaches the end of the list and automatically load more items.

Part 2: Optimization Challenge

    Objective: Demonstrate advanced skills in UI optimization in Unity to devices with limited resources. Task:

    Optimize Scrollview to handle 10,000+ items without financial manipulation of performance. 
    Provide a brief report in the repository explaining the optimization techniques applied ,and the results obtained. 
    
    Rating criteria
    
    Code Quality: Clarity, use of design patterns, modularity and ease of use maintenance.
    Performance: Efficiency in the use of user experience resources and specializations
