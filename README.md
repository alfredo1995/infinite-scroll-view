Technical test for a senior Unity developer 
focused on creating and optimizing a Infinite and recyclable scrollview. 

The test can be divided into parts: soft and optimization. 
Below, each of these parts is outlined.

Develop a ScrollView in Unity that is infinite and recyclable, 
optimized to handle a large number of elements 
without compromising performance. 

This component will be crucial for applications that appear in a large, dynamic list, such as feeds news, product lists or any interface that requires continuous and efficient scrolling of data

<br>

Part 1: Practical Implementation

Objective: Develop an infinite and recyclable Scrollview that can be used in webgl mobile and desktop applications. Requirements:

    1. Basic Functionality:
    
        Scrollview should be able to load and recycle elements
        efficiently without performance loss 
        when scrolling up and down infinitely.

        Data can be simple numbers or texts 
        that represent items.

    2. Interface and Interaction:
    
    Implement visual feedback to show that charging is
    occurring when new items are being uploaded.
    Make sure the scroll is smooth and without visual jumps or "lags".

    3. Data:
        Use a list of fictitious data (for example, a list of names or numbers)
        to demonstrate a functionality.

    4. Extras:
        
        Implemente uma funcionalidade “pull-to-refresh” no topo da lista.
        Adicione funcionalidade para detectar quando o usuário chega ao final da lista e carregar mais itens automaticamente.

Part 2: Optimization Challenge

    Objetivo: Demonstrar habilidades avançadas em otimização de UI no Unity para
    dispositivos com recursos limitados. Tarefa:

    Optimize Scrollview to handle 10,000+ items without financial manipulation of performance. 
    Provide a brief report in the repository explaining the optimization techniques applied and the results obtained. Rating criteria

    Code Quality: Clarity, use of design patterns, modularity and ease of use maintenance.
    Performance: Efficiency in the use of user experience resources and specializations
