Part 1: Practical Implementation

Develop an infinite and recyclable Scrollview that can be used in webgl mobile and desktop applications. 

    1. Basic Functionality:
    
        Scrollview should be able to load and recycle elements
        efficiently without performance loss when scrolling up and down infinitely.

        Data can be simple numbers or texts that represent items.

    2. Interface and Interaction:
    
        Implement visual feedback to show that charging is occurring when new items are being uploaded. 
        Make sure the scroll is smooth and without visual jumps or "lags".

    3. Data:
        Use a list of fictitious data to demonstrate a functionality.

    4. Extras:
        
    Implement a “pull-to-refresh” feature at the top of the list.
    Add functionality to detect when the user reaches the end of the list and automatically load more items.

Part 2: Optimization Challenge

    Objective: Demonstrate advanced skills in UI optimization in Unity to devices with limited resources. Task:

    Optimize Scrollview to handle 10,000+ items without financial manipulation of performance. 
    A brief report in the repository explaining the optimization techniques applied ,and the results obtained.
