Technical test for a senior Unity developer focused on creating and optimizing a
Infinite and recyclable scrollview. The test can be divided into parts: soft and
optimization. Below, each of these parts is outlined.

Develop a ScrollView in Unity that is infinite and recyclable, optimized to handle
a large number of elements without compromising performance. This component
will be crucial for applications that appear in a large, dynamic list, such as feeds
news, product lists or any interface that requires continuous and efficient scrolling
of data

<br>

Part 1: Practical Implementation

Objective: Develop an infinite and recyclable Scrollview that can be used in
webgl mobile and desktop applications. Requirements:

 1. Basic Functionality:
 - Scrollview must be able to load and recycle elements efficiently without
 loss of performance when scrolling up and down infinitely.
 - Data can be simple numbers or texts representing items.

 2. Interface and Interaction:
 - Implement visual feedback to show that charging is occurring when
 new items are being uploaded.
 - Make sure the scroll is smooth and without visual jumps or "lags".

 3. Data:
 - Use a list of fictitious data (for example, a list of names or numbers) to
 demonstrate a functionality.

 4. Extras:
 - Implement a "pull-to-refresh" functionality at the top of the list.
 - Add functionality to detect when the user reaches the end of the list and
 load more items automatically.

Part 2: Optimization Challenge

Objective: Demonstrate advanced skills in UI optimization in Unity for
devices with limited resources. Task:

 - Optimize Scrollview to handle 10,000+ items without financial manipulation of
 performance.
 - Provide a brief report in the repository explaining the optimization techniques applied
 and the results obtained.

Rating criteria

 - Code Quality: Clarity, use of design patterns, modularity and ease of use
 maintenance.
 - Performance: Efficiency in the use of user experience resources and specializations
